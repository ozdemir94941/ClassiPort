# ClassiPort – Secure Vault

> A basic front-end vault interface for restricted or classified information.

---

## 🔐 Description

**ClassiPort** is a simulated digital access portal designed for secure access to sensitive content. It represents a clean and minimal UI similar to internal systems used by intelligence or defense agencies.

Key features:
- Master password protection
- Sleek, responsive UI
- Modular HTML/CSS/JS structure
- No backend – frontend simulation only

This is intended as an **educational, UI/UX, or prototyping tool**, not a real secure system. It can be extended with real backend security layers later.
